What it does:

how to run layer:
python networkLayer.py port maxNoPackets delay probDrop probMangle

port int, maxNoPackets int, delay float, probDrop int, probMangle int 

example: python networkLayer.py 5002 100 1.0 0 0

how to run server:
python3 client.py host port

example: python cands.py "localhost" 5002

how to run client:
python cands.py host port inputfile

example: python cands.py "localhost" 5001 "sample.txt"

notes:
server+client handles one file then closes
40 byte checksum
largest file that can be handled is 119,085 bytes since 467 bytes of data in packet and 255 unique sequence numbers for data and 1 for file name.
