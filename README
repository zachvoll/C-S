What it does:
single file transfer from server to client over network layer using fixed length packets.
network layer has a chance to drop or mangle packets.
Timers and 40 byte checksum are used to handle packet issues.

how to run layer:
python networkLayer.py port maxNoPackets delay probDrop probMangle
port int, maxNoPackets int, delay float, probDrop int, probMangle int 
e.g. python networkLayer.py 5002 100 1.0 0 0

how to run server:
python cands.py host port
e.g. python cands.py "localhost" 5002
note: port must be the same as networkLayer port

how to run client:
python cands.py host port inputfile
e.g. python cands.py "localhost" 5001 "sample.txt"

notes:
largest file that can be handled is 119,085 bytes since 467 bytes of data in packet and 255 unique sequence numbers for data and 1 for file name.
